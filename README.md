##**Retail Analysis Project**

Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of household-level retail transaction data. The project involves data storage, processing, and visualization using various tools and platforms to ensure efficient handling and real-time insights.

Key Features
Data Storage: Uploaded and organized retail transaction data on AWS S3, ensuring that data is stored based on frequent patterns for optimal retrieval and management.

Data Processing: Connected AWS S3 to Snowflake for tracking continuous data uploads. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebook to uncover key insights.

Real-Time Visualization: Implemented an automated PowerBI dashboard that refreshes whenever new data is added to the S3 bucket, providing real-time access to data insights.

Tools & Technologies
AWS S3: For storing and managing the transaction data.
Snowflake: To handle and process data in conjunction with AWS S3.
Jupyter Notebook: For performing EDA and data analysis.
PowerBI: For creating dynamic, real-time dashboards.
How to Use
Data Upload: Upload your household-level retail transaction data to the designated AWS S3 bucket.
Data Analysis: Use Snowflake and Jupyter Notebook to perform exploratory data analysis on the uploaded data.
Dashboard Refresh: PowerBI dashboards will automatically refresh when data is updated in the S3 bucket, allowing you to view the latest insights.
